## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be mecab-ipadic-NEologd, Mecab and Japanese font to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I used the twitter Json data of a twitter account 'Tarinai Futari' through twitter API for this projrct to better understand:
(In 'Tarinai Futari' twutter account, Yamasato and Wakabayashi have a conversation.)

topic1 ... which gets more retweet and favorites, Wakabayashi or Yamasato?   
           Yamasato felt jealous to Wakabayashi because Wakabayashi got more favosite and retweet.
           I checked if it's true or not
topic2 ...  how word Yamasata and Wakabayashi use the most frearuently  

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook and 1 csv data available here to showcase work related to the above questions.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://qiita.com/m-wakatsuru/items/16dbbe9a084be5a81de9).
(Sorry, this blog is written in Japanese.)

Breifly..  
result1 ... Wakabayashi got more fovorite and reteeet in every term than Yamasato
result2 ... Wakabayashi used the word 'Yamasato' the most frequently.
            Yamasato also used 'Wakabayashi-kun' the most frequently.
